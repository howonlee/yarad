Yet Another Relativization-Avoiding Diagonalization
====

I got pique after like 5 months of dealing with this and trying to find the counterexample so I'm just publishing this without the actual disproof and trusting some cool peeps to go find it. Here it is, anyhow.

> A method of diagonalization with contrary relativizations is given that is not the familiar $IP=PSPACE$-style arithmetization technique. Instead of computing wrong answers for queries, we compute the correct answers, but too slowly. We call it _stupid diagonalization_ for humor value and for contrast to lazy diagonalization. Also given is a putative chain of reasoning to a class separation with great humor value known to have contrary relativizations, given a relaxation.

The basic trivial path that I already tried a bunch already is to dunk on it by giving the oracle different stuff, basically like Aaronson and Widgerson's algebrization. But the trouble goes, if you give the oracle some way to go slowly, the basic original BGS result goes "boing" and disappears like a carpet bubble! There's probably some clever way that avoids this phenomenon I saw.
